    <p>
      Patrick Billy is a French designer of inclusive digital tools,
      specializing in complex, constrained, or low-infrastructure environments.
      He works at the intersection of digital accessibility,
      inclusion, work analysis, and applied artificial intelligence.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a background in graphic design, training, and field-based design,
      Patrick develops tools that adapt to people — not the other way around.
      His philosophy is straightforward:
      <strong>simple, robust, and genuinely useful solutions</strong>
      for teachers, employees, people with disabilities,
      families, and any organization facing real-world situations.
    </p>

    <h2>Élan pour Tous</h2>
    <p>
      He founded <strong>Élan pour Tous</strong> based on a clear observation:
      many technologies are designed for idealized environments,
      while real-world conditions are often complex,
      fragmented, and unpredictable.
      Patrick therefore creates tools that function
      <strong>without internet access, without expensive hardware,
      and without unnecessary complexity</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Mini-WTD (Work-Test-Demo)</h2>
    <p>
      Patrick is also the creator of <strong>Mini-WTD</strong>,
      a simulator designed to analyze work situations.
      It allows tasks to be examined,
      constraints to be understood,
      feasibility to be evaluated,
      and concrete workplace adaptations to be proposed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mini-WTD is now used in various contexts:
      schools, companies, medical-social institutions,
      independent trainers, and low-tech environments
      such as overseas territories or areas with limited connectivity.
    </p>

    <h2>Areas of Expertise</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Digital accessibility (RGAA / WCAG)</li>
      <li>Inclusive design & simplified interfaces</li>
      <li>Applied AI for explanation, guidance, and simplification</li>
      <li>Low-tech and offline tools (USB solutions, intranet, constrained contexts)</li>
      <li>Activity analysis and task simulation</li>
      <li>Workplace adaptation & inclusive pedagogy</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Working Between France and Madagascar</h2>
    <p>
      Patrick primarily works in France,
      but also develops tools adapted to Malagasy
      and broader African realities,
      where digital infrastructures are often limited.
      Understanding real-world situations is central to his approach:
      he designs tools that operate
      where conventional solutions fail.
    </p>

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>

    <p>
      His entire work is based on one conviction:
      <em>technology should reduce cognitive and operational load, not increase it.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      His tools are designed for people
      who may not like technology,
      who are tired, overwhelmed,
      or facing challenging circumstances.
      This is precisely where simplicity becomes strength.
